# React Things

A exploratory list of React ecosystem solutions

The React ecosystem is very young, and it's exploding with enthusiastic contributions. This list is an attempt to surface best practices and useful modules to help us build React applications.

This is a curated list. Intentionally not exhaustive. I'm using it to help me decide on the tools I want to use in my projects. If it helps you, too, that's great. If your favorite thing doesn't make the cut, fork the list and curate your own! We're all explorers, here. Blaze a trail.
